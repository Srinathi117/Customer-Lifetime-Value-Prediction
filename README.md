# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

## Overview

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a key metric that helps businesses estimate the total value a customer will bring over their lifetime. This project focuses on predicting the CLV of customers based on their historical interactions with the business. The goal is to build a regression model that estimates the future value of a customer, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions regarding customer retention, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project contains historical data of customers, including interactions such as purchase frequency, average order value, customer engagement, and other features that could influence their lifetime value. These features are used to build a regression model that predicts the total value a customer is likely to generate over a given period.

## Requirements

- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
